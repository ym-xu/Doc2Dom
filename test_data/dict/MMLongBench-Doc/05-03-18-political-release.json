The survey was conducted by interviewers under the direction of Abt Associates. A combination of landline and  cell phone random digit dial samples were used; both samples were provided by Survey Sampling  International. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Respondents in the landline  sample were selected by randomly asking for the youngest adult male or female who is now at  home. Interviews in the cell sample were conducted with the person who answered the phone, if  that person was an adult 18 years of age or older.

The sample also is weighted to match current  patterns of telephone status (landline only, cell phone only, or both landline and cell phone), based  on extrapolations from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both landline and cell phones have a greater  probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household size among  respondents with a landline phone. The margins of error reported and statistical tests of  significance are adjusted to account for the survey’s design effect, a measure of how much  efficiency is lost from the weighting procedures.",
