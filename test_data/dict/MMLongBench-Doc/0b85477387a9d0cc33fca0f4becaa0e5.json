This  past August the Navy Surgeon General entered an agreement with the Commander,  Submarine Forces (CSF) that established NSMRL as CSF‟s primary human technology laboratory, including all physical and mental aspects of submariner health and  performance. NSMRL is tasked to conduct medical, psychological and human performance research; provide independent, objective reviews of human systems related projects and technology proposed for CSF use; and develop new and innovative concepts for CSF that use human technology. Working directly with Vice Adm.  Connor (CSF), NSMRL is aligned with the submarine force strategic direction. NSMRL also conducts investigations in diving medicine. This year NSMRL saw the  addition of an external hatch on the Genesis hyperbaric chamber. This addition allows the chamber to draw a vacuum and be “flown” at pressures representative of  those encountered at high altitudes. Unique features of this chamber include the ability to lock-in and lock-out at depth or altitude, allowing for prolonged (months) studies. It also has the ability to study  mission profiles that transition from depth to altitude and vice versa (picture a Special Operations Forces mission locking out of submarine and then scaling a mountain) without requiring any configuration changes. Recently NSMRL acquired NAVSEA‟s new DP1/2 diving system. The DP1/2 is a surface supplied air system that ",

They might be just as relieved as you are to set limits on spending or, in some cases, to skip gift-giving entirely. Look for ways to cut back on the number of gifts you buy. If you have a large family or group of friends, ask if  they'd like to draw names out of a hat and give one gift per person. Or give family gifts, such as a movies-by-mail  membership or a pass to a local museum rather than individual gifts.",
