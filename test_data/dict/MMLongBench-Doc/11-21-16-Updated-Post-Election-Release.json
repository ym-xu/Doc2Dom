The survey was conducted by  interviewers at Princeton Data Source under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates  International. Interviews were conducted on both landline telephones and cell phones (312 respondents for this survey were interviewed on a landline telephone, and 942 were interviewed  on a cell phone). Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Interviewers asked to speak  with the respondent from the previous interview by first name, if it was available, or by age and  gender.

The sample of all  registered voters contacted for this survey was then raked - by form - to match parameters for sex  by age, sex by education, age by education, region, race/ethnicity, population density, phone use.  The non-Hispanic, white subgroup was also raked to age, education and region. These parameters  came from the weighted demographics of registered voters interviewed from the original surveys  from which sample was drawn. In addition, a parameter was added to the weighting so that the  vote results reported in the survey match the actual popular vote results. Sampling errors and  statistical tests of significance take into account the effect of weighting.",
