This  past August the Navy Surgeon General entered an agreement with the Commander,  Submarine Forces (CSF) that established NSMRL as CSF‟s primary human technology laboratory, including all physical and mental aspects of submariner health and  performance. NSMRL is tasked to conduct medical, psychological and human performance research; provide independent, objective reviews of human systems related projects and technology proposed for CSF use; and develop new and innovative concepts for CSF that use human technology. Working directly with Vice Adm.  Connor (CSF), NSMRL is aligned with the submarine force strategic direction. NSMRL also conducts investigations in diving medicine. This year NSMRL saw the  addition of an external hatch on the Genesis hyperbaric chamber. This addition allows the chamber to draw a vacuum and be “flown” at pressures representative of  those encountered at high altitudes. Unique features of this chamber include the ability to lock-in and lock-out at depth or altitude, allowing for prolonged (months) studies. It also has the ability to study  mission profiles that transition from depth to altitude and vice versa (picture a Special Operations Forces mission locking out of submarine and then scaling a mountain) without requiring any configuration changes. Recently NSMRL acquired NAVSEA‟s new DP1/2 diving system. The DP1/2 is a surface supplied air system that",

Danett Bishop focused on \"phases of matter\" and used dry ice and basic laboratory equipment to teach the concept to third graders.\n\n**Visual Features**:\n- **Color**: The photo is in color, with the officer wearing a naval uniform.\n- **Layout**: The text is formatted in a standard paragraph style, with the photo placed to the right of the text.\n- **Graphics**: The photo is the primary visual element, with no additional graphics in the target region.\n\n**Context Integration**:\nThe target region is part of a larger article that discusses various activities and events involving naval officers and their interactions with students and the community. The photo and accompanying text highlight an educational outreach effort by the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) officers.\n\n**Purpose**:\nThe purpose of this content is to showcase the educational outreach activities of the NMRC officers, specifically their engagement with elementary school students to teach them about the phases of matter and atomic theory using practical demonstrations. This aligns with the broader theme of the article, which emphasizes the NMRC's role in community engagement and education."

As promised, because we are in the midst  of the holiday season, this month I‟m presenting additional holiday budgeting tips. Not to be a Scrooge, but many  people blow their holiday budgets because they get carried away by the excitement of the season. It's important to  remember that you can still have a joyous holiday season without busting your budget. Here are some more ways to  save money during the holidays.",
